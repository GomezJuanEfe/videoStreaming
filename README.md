# Video Streaming - Frontend practice

Hi, I'm Juan Felipe Gómez Ramírez, I'm from Colombia and this is a workshop to practice all I've been studying about web development until now.

This project is a mix about Platzi Frontend Developer course and Figma Video Streaming project by Afsar.

Platzi - Frontend Developer Course: https://platzi.com/clases/frontend-developer/

Figma - Video Streaming project by Afsar: https://www.figma.com/community/file/978204688923563508

The idea to mix this two things it's in order to create something new and challenge myself to do something different.
