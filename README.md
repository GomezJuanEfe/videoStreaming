# Video Streaming - Frontend practice

Hi, I'm Juan Felipe Gómez Ramírez, I'm from Colombia and this is a workshop to practice all I've been studying about web development until now.

This project is a mix about Platzi Frontend Developer course and Figma Video Streaming project by Afsar. You can see the links bellow on the links section

The idea to mix this two things it's in order to create something new and challenge myself to do something different.

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pug - html preprocessor
- SASS - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned

#### Pug

- To watch PUG files

    pug -w . -o ./html -P

    // Note in the above command, the -w option stands for watch,
    //the dot tells Pug to watch everything in the current directory,
    //-o ./html tells Pug to output its HTML in the html directory and the
    //-P option prettifies the output.

    //The way this is going to work is that we’ll write our Pug code in index.pug
    //and have the pug-cli watch this file for changes. When it detects any,
    //it will take the contents of index.pug and render it as HTML
    //in the html directory.

### SASS

- To watch a SASS file
  
  watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

  sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets

  Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.

### Continued development

I'll continue learning about CSS and HTML. The next topic will be preprocessors and JavaScript.
